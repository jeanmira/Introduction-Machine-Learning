# Implementing KNN, MLP, and SVM Methods for Classification

## Description

This project implements the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron), and SVM (Support Vector Machine) classification methods using the Iris dataset. The goal is to compare the performance of these methods using different configurations and evaluate their accuracy using 10-fold cross-validation.

### Methods:

- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors):**
  - Test at least two different numbers of nearest neighbors.
  
- **MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron):**
  - Test at least two different configurations of the network, varying the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons per layer.
  
- **SVM (Support Vector Machine):**
  - Test at least two different kernels.

### Dataset:

- The Iris dataset is used for this project, but any other dataset can be used as well.

## Usage

The `methods.py` file contains the implementation of these methods. You can run the file to see the results.

```bash
python methods.py
